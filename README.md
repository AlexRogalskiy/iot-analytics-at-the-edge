# GTM Stack: IoT Data Analytics at the Edge

## Exploring IoT Data Analytics at the Edge with Mosquitto, TimescaleDB, and Grafana, on ARM-based Architecture

Source code for the post, [IoT Data Analytics at theÂ Edge](https://medium.com/@GaryStafford/iot-data-analytics-at-the-edge-d116b6681d7b).

In the post, we will explore the integration of several open-source software applications to build an IoT edge analytics stack, designed to operate on ARM-based edge nodes. We will use the stack to collect, analyze, and visualize IoT data, without first shipping the data to Cloud or other external systems.
